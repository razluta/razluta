Hi, this is Raz.\
I'm a Technical Artist, which for me means I enjoy making art content as much as I enjoy writing software.\
I work primarily on automating content pipelines and make tools in and around Unity (well DCC packages - Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, Substance Painter, Substance Designer etc. + Unity Editor and Engine).\
I mainly work in C#, but dabble in Python, C++ and JavaScript on occasion.
