# Razvan (Raz) Luta --- @razluta
Hi, this is Raz. 
I'm a Technical Artist, which for me means I enjoy making art content as much as I enjoy writing software.
I work primarily on automating content pipelines and make tools in and around Unity (well DCC packages - Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, etc. + Unity).
I mainly work in C#, but dabble in Python, C++ and JavaScript on occasion.
