# Razvan (Raz) Luta --- @razluta
Hi, this is Raz.\
By day, I am a Technical Art Manager at [Unity Techologies](https://unity.com/)\
I'm a Technical Artist, which for me means I enjoy making art content as much as I enjoy writing software.\
I work primarily on automating content pipelines and make tools in and around Unity (well DCC packages - Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop, Substance Painter, Substance Designer etc. + Unity Editor and Engine).\
I mainly work in C# and Python, but dabble in C++ and JavaScript on occasion.
